# Netherboard
## WORK IN PROGRESS!

Scoreboard API for your Minecraft Bukkit Plugins (Sponge will probably be supported in the future).

- Works for all the Bukkit versions since 1.7.
- No blinking!
- Max characters per line:
  - 1.7: 16 (Working on it to allow 48 characters)
  - 1.8+: 40 (Working on it to allow 72 characters, *not sure if possible, we'll see*)
  
### TODO:
- Sponge support
- Allow more characters per line (Using teams)
- Add a javadoc
- Improve this readme
